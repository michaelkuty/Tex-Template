\section{Introduction}

Python daemon for collecting data from peripherals(sensors, ..) and sending instructions into external actuators.

\subsection{Motivation}

Lowermost layer of Robotice which must resolve differences in single-board computers(BB, Rpi, etc.). We must have driver for every device and every platform.

\subsection{Goals}

\begin{description}

\item[Collecting and Acting] - GPIO, I2C drivers etc.
\item[Autonomous] - collecting and acting must work without internet connection
\item[Support] - support for most of OS and SB computers

\end{description}

\subsection{Problem Statement}

\begin{itemize}

\item{Drivers for external peripheral devices(GPIO, I2C, ..)}
\item{Differences in single-board computers}
\item{Differences on the OS Layer(pkgs, etc.)}

\end{itemize}
